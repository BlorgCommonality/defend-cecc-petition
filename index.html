		<h1>CECC Students' Petition Against 'Renew ANU': Defending Our College's Identity and Future</h1>
		<p>As students of the ANU College of Engineering, Computing, and Cybernetics (CECC), we are very proud of our
			college’s distinguished legacy, academic excellence, and its crucial role in shaping the future of technology and
			innovation. However, the proposed "Renew ANU" realigning threatens to damage the identity and integrity of CECC.
			The renaming of our college, along with drastic budget cuts, will not only diminish its international reputation
			but also negatively impact education quality, research opportunities, and the future prospects of all students.
		</p>
		<p>The university claims that these reforms are “reorganising the schools within the College system” so it will have
			“limited impact on students.” Yet, students have been excluded from the consultation process. In our own college's
			Townhall meeting, where many expressed significant concerns about the changes, the recording was mysteriously lost
			due to “technical issues.” This lack of transparency only heightens our concerns about the direction of these
			reforms.</p>
		<p>Due to these concerns, we, the students of CECC, submit the following petition to defend our college’s identity,
			ensure transparency, and demand meaningful student involvement in the decision-making process.</p>

		<h2>Petition Demands:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Opposition to Renaming the College to "College of Systems and Society"</strong><br>
				We believe that "Systems and Society" does not adequately represent the core disciplines of Engineering,
				Computing, and Cybernetics. This new name diminishes the focus on technical fields and weakens the college's
				international standing and appeal. We propose that the college be renamed to "College of Engineering, Computing,
				and Systems", which better reflects the distinctive areas of expertise and preserves the technical identity of
				the college.</li>

			<li><strong>Request to Extend the Consultation Period and Provide More Information</strong><br>
				The current consultation period is too short for all stakeholders, especially students, to provide meaningful
				input. We demand that the consultation period be extended to at least six weeks, with additional open
				discussions and meetings scheduled. Furthermore, we request detailed information on the specific budget cuts and
				restructuring impact, so that everyone affected can understand the future direction of the college.</li>

			<li><strong>Opposition to Budget Cuts</strong><br>
				Budget cuts will have long-term negative effects on academic resources, research opportunities, and
				infrastructure. We request that the university provide a clear explanation for the proposed cuts and how the
				funds will be reallocated. While the short-term impact on courses may be limited, we are concerned about the
				long-term academic and research environment. Therefore, we oppose any cuts that will diminish the quality of
				education and research.</li>

			<li><strong>Demand for Student Involvement and Transparency</strong><br>
				The restructuring process lacks transparency, and student voices have not been adequately heard. We demand that
				in future major decisions, students be formally represented and given access to complete and open discussion
				records. Additionally, we request that a new Townhall meeting be arranged specifically for students and that it
				be recorded for review by students and staff alike.</li>

			<li><strong>Protection of the College’s Identity and Reputation</strong><br>
				As a leading institution in Engineering, Computing, and Cybernetics, we are deeply concerned that the
				restructuring and budget cuts will harm the college’s international reputation, which will in turn affect
				students' future career prospects. We ask the university to provide more concrete measures on how the
				restructuring will enhance the college’s competitiveness and standing in these fields.</li>
